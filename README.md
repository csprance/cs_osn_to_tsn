# Object Space Normals To Tangent Space Normals
A modo kit by @csprance to convert an OSN to a TSN directly inside of modo using xNormal.

## Installation
This is a modo kit so install it like normal. I've only tested this on Modo 12, but I don't think it's doing anything
fancy. Let me know if you run into any issues and if it works on other versions of modo!
* Extract/Clone into `%appdata%/Luxology/Kits`
* Restart modo

## How to use
* `Right Click` on a texture clip in modo and select "Convert OSN -> TSN"

## Uninstallation process
* Delete `cs_osn_to_tsn` from `%appdata%/Luxology/Kits`

## Credits

* Thanks to the guys in the modo Developers Channel. Super friendly bunch of dudes helped me a lot.
